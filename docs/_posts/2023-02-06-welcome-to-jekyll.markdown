This website is being created during the month of February, 2023. Powered by jekyll and github pages using the so simple theme.
Once I have *figured some things out* I'll be using it as a personal blog to post some doodles, some links to analysis work I've done, perhaps a blog for my gardening and a page for recipes...

Mostly, it's just a *learning experience* :)

Cheeeeeeeerio!

# Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

# {% highlight ruby %}
# def print_hi(name)
  #puts "Hi, #{name}"
# end
# print_hi('Tom')
# #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
# {% endhighlight %}

# Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
